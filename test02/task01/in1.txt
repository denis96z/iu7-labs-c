...Guess what! I'm ill with ñhiñkenpos and the doctor says I have tî stay in bed for at least the
next two weeks. It's awfu! Have you ever had to stay in bed for a long time because you were 
ill? How am I going to pass the time? I'll be so bored! What can I do for two weeks in bed? I'm
going to miss such a lot îf school work, too. How will I manage to catch up? Wow!
Write soon, 
Love,
